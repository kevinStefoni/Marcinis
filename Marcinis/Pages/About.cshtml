                    Alfredo Marcini was a simple man, but his cooking was anything but. Using recipes handed down through generations, Marcini perfected the authentic and bold flavors of his family and opened a small restaurant in Naples, Italy.
                    The success of his restaurant has now led to over 400 franchised restaurants spanning the globe. Although the scale is much larger, Marcini's prides itself on staying true to our initial small restaurant in Naples. At Marcinis
                    you will find the freshest ingredients and the most authentic Italian experience. Let us bring Naples to you!
